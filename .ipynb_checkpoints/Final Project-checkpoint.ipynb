Since we do not need so many data with the same type, we will only keep two of them. Our choice would \"Ward\" and \"BID\". The reason for that is \"BID\" are the ways that we use the most in our daily life and \"Ward\" contains less regions so it's easier to do analysis on.

To do this, we found an website called geojson.io where we can dump in our geojson file and see the source code of it. Please view more details at http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0. Finally, we have our neccessary data. Now we want to sort our database based on each ward. Below, crimedata2 is our sorted database.

It has an number of crimes that dramatically excceed other BIDs.
